Description: Print and plot functions for genetic and evolutionary algorithms
             and selected problem environments support the visualization of
             the solutions found by genetic or evolutionary algorithms as well 
             as 1-D and 2-D projections of k-dimensional real functions.
             In addition, a plot of the development of 
             the population statistics of an algorithm run as well as 
             the printing of time profiles of the main algorithm components
             and their comparison are provided for the convenience of the 
             user.
